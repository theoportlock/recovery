Design and Methods
- Participants and Data Source
This section details the Nipper Project dataset, including the 585 female participants from New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom etc.

Experimental Design
This describes the longitudinal study design with six time points, focusing on nutritional intervention and its effects on the maternal gut microbiome and mental health scores.

Microbiome Data Processing
Computational steps to filter and prepare the microbiome data for analysis - kneaddata metaphlan humann

Data Analysis Methods
- Statistical Software and Packages
This lists the specific software and R/Python packages, with their versions, used for data processing and analysis.

Alpha and Beta Diversity Analysis
- This explains how Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), UMAP, and PERMANOVA were used to visualize and test differences in overall microbial community composition.

Differential Abundance Analysis (MaAsLin3)
This section details the use of MaAsLin3 to identify specific microbial taxa associated with changes in mental component scores over time, accounting for fixed and random effects.

Correlation Analysis (Spearman's)
This explains the use of Spearman's correlation to measure the non-linear relationship between individual microbial taxa and MCS values.

Predictive Modeling (Random Forest)
This describes the use of a Random Forest model to identify the key microbial markers that are most predictive of MCS.
