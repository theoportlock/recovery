Hi Chatgpt, I am looking to do some analysis around two separate refeed methods for childhood malnutrition between 1-2yrs of age. at baseline there were 140 MAM kids (70 on refeed A and 70 on refeed B) mixed with 70 healthy controls at both timepoints. my figures for the paper was first figure: recovery curves for change in weight from baseline as well as a small summary figure of the study design. Then, for figure 2, I was going to do a baseline predict figure where each recorded dataset  ( microbiome, anthropometrics, SES, EEG etc) were used to predict recovery (achieved wlz/whz of -1 SD) and isolate the important features/significantly different features that associate with recovery. Then for figure3, i was going to try an approach were I compare the distributions (beta diversities) of each group (MAM RefeedA yr1, MAM RefeedB yr1, MAM RefeedA yr2, Healthy Yr2 etc) and, by looking at the differences (PERMANOVA) between  each refeed method at each timepoint compared with healthy (ie does the distance from healthy shrink over the study period), measure how effective each refeed method was in imrpoving healthy development. Then for figure 4 I was going to do a differential network analysis where I take (for the datasets that have 2 timepoints) the delta between the timepoints to remove the time dimention and use all the data in a random forest model to predict recovery with nodes as important features (SHAP) and edges as important interactions (SHAP interactions).
