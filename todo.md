# Throughout
Recovery definition
Maaslin3 for all datasets - baseline, delta, yr2 and longitudinal - sigsummary
Supp tables include
Are the baseline predictors more likely to be changing towards a healthy direction?
Check with other paper from Chucks group
    Mixed model for WLZ as per https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/scitranslmed.adn2366
    The confounding variables include socio-demographic variables (age, sex, and residence of the child), the presenting symptoms, comorbid illnesses, immunization status, medications and nutritional supplements. A full examination, including the grade of edema, dehydration status, skin changes, and vital signs (respiratory rate, pulse rate, and temperature) was performed by the data collectors. Stool examination and hematocrit count were checked from the laboratory report in the medical history sheet.

2. Baseline influences of recovery - forcasting
can improve the proportion script and testing script
SHAP insensitive to model choice, check
Comparison of SHAP vs Maaslin
Check the metrics for the regression
    Can try with pycaret to improve the prediction
    remove the days to recovery

3. Are the changes moving more healthy?
Premature microbiome maturation
Remake polar and check approach
Need to include the multiline plots to confirm here

4. Twins
How do the factors in earlier part correlate (compare polars)

# other
Not going to remake the humann4
newplotbar plotbar - merge
simplecorr - consider removing
other datasets: 04 LEAP mother enromlent info, Eligibility - Language Difficulty or Delay in q8d - also depression - some flaws in this

# Questions
How well is recovery predicted from baseline?
What Datasets were best predictors and are there combinations of features that are important?
