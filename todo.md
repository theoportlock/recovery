# Check gnthro
recovery was defined as at least one tp where it crosses -1 SD within THREE MONTHS - however, seems like 15 weeks

# Throughout

Are the baseline predictors more likely to be changing towards a healthy direction?

    Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted to assess the association between time to recovery and the type of therapeutic food, controlling for the confounding variables.

    The confounding variables include socio-demographic variables (age, sex, and residence of the child), the presenting symptoms, comorbid illnesses, immunization status, medications and nutritional supplements. A full examination, including the grade of edema, dehydration status, skin changes, and vital signs (respiratory rate, pulse rate, and temperature) was performed by the data collectors. Stool examination and hematocrit count were checked from the laboratory report in the medical history sheet.
